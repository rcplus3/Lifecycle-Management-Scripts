# Lifecycle Management Scripts
An open-source tool to activate and reset the test of [Lifecycle Management](https://www.lifecyclemanagement.org/)

# Disclaimer
I want to clarify that I am not the original author of this script. When I initially published this script on GitHub, the primary author had not yet created an official GitHub repository. As a result, the only available option for users was to visit the [official forum](https://www.nsaneforums.com/topic/371047--/?do=findComment%5E&comment=1578647) to download and utilize the script, later they created the [Github](https://github.com/WindowsAddict/Lifecycle-Management-Scripts) repository. My main aim in creating this repository was to streamline the process for users. Furthermore, I ensured to credit the original creators of the script as a sign of respect for their work.

* Right-click on the downloaded zip file and extract
* In the extracted folder, run the file named `LM.cmd`
* You will see the activation options, and follow onscreen instructions.
* Thatâ€™s all.

# Info
## Freeze test
* LM provides a 30-day test period, you can use this option in the script to lock this test period for the lifetime so that you wonâ€™t have to reset the test again and your test wonâ€™t expire.
* This method requires the Internet at the time of applying this option.
* LM updates can be installed directly without having to freeze it again.

## Activation
(***Currently not working**)

* This script applies the registry lock method to activate the Lifecycle Management (LM).
* This method requires the Internet at the time of activation.
* LM updates can be installed directly without having to activate it again.
* After the activation, if in some cases, LM starts to show an activation nag screen, then just run the activation option again without using the reset option.

## Reset Lifecycle Management / test
* Lifecycle Management provides a 30-day test period, you can use this script to reset this Activation / test period whenever you want.
* This option also can be used to restore status if in case LM reports a fake serial key and other similar errors.

## OS requirement
* The project is supported for Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11 and their Server equivalent.
* The PowerShell method to run LM is supported on Windows 8 and higher.

## Advanced Info
* To activate in unattended mode, run the script with the /act parameter.
* To freeze the test in unattended mode, run the script with the /frz parameter.
* To reset in unattended mode, run the script with the /res parameter.

# How does it work?
* LM stores the data related to test and activation across various registry keys. Some of these keys are locked to protect them from tampering and data is stored in a pattern to track the fake serial issue and the remaining test days. To activate it, the script here simply generates those registry keys by triggering a few downloads in LM, identifies those registry keys, and locks them so LM canâ€™t edit and view them. That way LM cannot show the warning that itâ€™s activated with a fake serial key.

# Troubleshoot
* Browser Integration Fix: [Chrome](https://www.lifecyclemanagement.org/register/new_faq/bi9.html) - [Firefox](https://www.lifecyclemanagement.org/register/new_faq/bi4.html)
* Reach out to me on [Telegram](https://t.me/rcplus3) with an error screenshot.
